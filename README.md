# Decision Lab

> Run your decision before you live it.

Decision Lab is a structured thinking interface designed to simulate real-life decisions before you make them.

Instead of reacting emotionally, users can run scenarios, reflect on consequences, and gain clarity through guided prompts.

## 🧠 What It Does

Decision Lab helps users think through:

- 🗑 Should I Throw This Away?  
- 💬 Should I Text My Ex?  
- 💼 Should I Quit My Job?  
- 💔 Should I Break Up?  
- 📦 Should I Move?  

Each module acts as a decision simulator — structured, neutral, and reflective.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Most decisions are emotional.  
Decision Lab creates distance.

By simulating outcomes before acting, users reduce regret and increase clarity.
